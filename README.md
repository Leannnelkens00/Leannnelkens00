The problem your picking up in my reading is that I am actually the person known as Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.



I'm a chick from BC Canada. 42 years old. I love dogs and exploring abandoned buildings. I am a certified dog groomer, artist, writer and treasure hunter. I live in a trailer park currently and when, years ago I was home from university in the UK, (I got a scolarship) I came up with a bit of  an idea that eventually became what we know as Bitcoin. I was trying to shut down a cult in new Mexico using journalistic tactics.. it was a boring summer, and I was on the  computer a lot.

 I ended up with a discord and then a github account and by random clicking I found myself signed up on a forum I had no business being on. It was a bunch of programmers. I ended up, still bored and reading the threads and this one post caught my eye.

 It was a guy asking how to be free. His concern on the matter had me intrigued. I could feel his frustration and was compelled to reply. I said freedom is not possible without financial autonomy. And then everything spiraled from  there. I basically ended up in months long back and forth with the programmers causing arguments,healthy debate, anyways.. enjoying chance to actually use some of my lesser appreciated (around here anyways) skills. I took epistemology at a masters level and thought it was super fun. it translated somehow but since I am the worst at coding, it was way beyond anything I could do with regaurds to the actual whitepaper. The technical pieces were piggybacked off my account because according to the government I am mentally disabled, and I probably should wear a hemet. 

 Explaination: My mom is a pretty unsavory person: extremely narcissistic and has I belive, even undiagnosed munchausens by proxy.  She had been claiming I was mentally disabled since I was young and since she was so influentual in the ministry and court system, with friends in government she was able to manipulate many well meaning folk to do many illegal things.  By the time I found ou, it was too late. I'm a walking liability. No one wants to touch my case because of the lawsuits and potential lashbacks.  

This is why I was perfect for this role to be the one to unveil this idea. I made up the name Satoshi Nakamoto out of the front credits of my favorite Manga, Blade of the Immortal. A writer and an artist, I believe.. my middle name is Sara and my last name is Nelkenbrecher. L. S. N.
I had no idea the absolute uniqueness of the situation I was in, but then again, does anyone, until looking back later at the history and how everything unfolds.



Back to my history, so I was perfect for this role. Mr. Hal had me send him a transaction, stating "don't worry."

I felt like he actually cared about me and he understood that I knew what I was about to do, and there was a hopeful yet worried aspect to our last conversation. Any communication I had with signing the blocks and whatever else was on a black window that popped up on my screen and red letters.

I signed the first block with the headline from a newspaper I got out of the Shopper's Drugmart dumpster. I love reading foreign news and the current issues are too expensive for me so I have to wait until they are thrown out.  I figured it was appropriate and would signal to everyone I understood my role and accepted it. I knew the risks. I went towards this fate with my eyes open, and in hope that some day my life would account for something. 
I signed another later backwards because I had been watching a documentary on Leonardo Devinci and how he wrote backwards, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Didn't turn out as good as the letters still face forward.


In 2008 I was't at my best, I had a drug addiction, while managable was taking its tole. I felt helpless as every time I tried to go ahead and become somebody amd make a contribution of any kind in this word I would get nowhere. I had just started to suspect my mother, (The-Anti-Mother) as a ( mostly contributing) factor to this repeated failure and while it was still a bit clouded, my vision of how my life was going to play out was dark. I honestly did not think I would live to see my 30th birthday and I ended up living on the street subconsciously I guess I felt free to make my way there, amongst the rejects and crazy's, where in civilization no mater what I did I ended up hitting a wall. I couldn't hold a job because that would bring to question my competency, where, according to my paperwork, I was incapable of basic, daily living tasks. I found of years later my anti-mother would literally sabotage any job I held. I mean, except for the few times I did that quite well on my own. :p



 Even the advocates I consulted were at a loss and I could see they saw the truth but it was so extreme and so far beyond anything that they felt they could deal with. Basically if what I say is true it could end up with lawsuits at a level unseen since the residential school tragedies. 

I'm a walking liability, and this is just the beginning... I saw they felt for me and I had to take that as comfort and get on with life. I accepted this but I was angry. I was angry with the people and system that allowed for me to be sacrificed and all because of financial issues. I was angry with the family and peope in the community who saw what waa going on since  I was a young child but didn't do anything, not wanting to get invoved. I was mad at the system that was set up to harbour and protect somebody all because of the financial cost.



When I answered that first post this was the point in my life in which I approached the question of how to be free.



Financial autonomy is required for any individual to successfully pursue their own happiness's.



I am not a programmer, I rather suck, even though occasionally I take a crack at it. I am not a cryptographer of any sort, what I am is a student of life and times, past and present. I guess you could say that is a sort of philosopher.



I dropped out of university after showing up for the first day of my last classes, (of a double major in English Lit and Psychology,)  before graduating to be told I was not in the class. I found out my major had been switched to Education by my mom who used to be a Dean there,  and no matter how I tried I couldn't get it switched back. I know there must of been something I could have done but by that time it was a whole life of these type of incidents, I just gave up and ended up drifting across Canada, hitchhiking, staying in abomedded houses and on mountain ranges. I was by myself for so long, never spending much time in any given place. I've lived everywhere from the streets of East Hastings, Vancouver, small towns in the middle of the prairies, to Moncton, New Brunswick. I always hustled and never succumbed to the easy money that most of my peers did, which is mostly why I believe I am still alive. I am sober from drugs, but enjoy whisky neat and a good cigar. 



I am still no closer to figuring out this whole thing or undoing it but over the years I gained some wisdom and seek to live a simple, unencumbered and sucessful to whatever extent I can make it. I am a broke-ass billionaire. And that's the truth. Must be the first in history. After the US went o announce its inclusion of crypto a few months back i went to see if I could cash in a little bit of my accrued mining money. It goes back to 2009, but found my wallets emptied. I had promised I wouldn't touch anything until it was safe for Bitcoin because of investor confidence. My original email and github had been hacked and deleted. And I find my wallets on another user's dashboard. I am basically having to play catchup to everything that has happened since 2016 and it's a rough go. People in my area aren't too informed about crypto so anyone who knows me well enough to understand it's totally possible that I am Satoshi Nakamoto, don't have the technical know how needed to solve a big problem. People who do are not listening past the first minute because when the evidence I produce points right to me being Satoshi Nakamoto they can't get beyond their preconceived notions of Satoshi being an older man. This is the biggest problem  thats needing to be solved first, maybe. I personally don't find it hard to think of a woman and even someone of my socioeconomic background as coming up with an idea like that. In fact doesn't it make sense that someone in the world who has personally experienced setbacks due to who or where they were born would be the best at finding a solution?  It's kind of pathetic, my attempts at figuring it out, perhaps. But on the other hand I think it's a story that can still end well, if I reach the right people who see the value in what I am saying  before it's too late. It would also prove a long held belief that anyone, and I really mean anyone is capable of making choices, good or bad, and then acting on them where it does end up changing the world. 



Back to the timeline...



This was easier than one would think to drop off the map and remain unfound.  An incident where two people tried to kill me ended up being the catalyst. It wasn't the first time I have had to fight for my life and that last time I am certain it had something to do with my involvement in crypto. The extreme violence of that incident caused a type of dissasociative fugue... until last summer. All of a sudden something someone said cause me to start remembering. I've basically gone from 2016 until 2024 not remembering or knowing I am the Satoshi Nakamoto. I guess my brain is smarter than me because this is probably what has kept me safe. I get more memories back every day now but even with that I am still no closer to figuring out how to solve the mess I've come back to find.

Generalization vs. Decentralization. None of my wallets have anything left in them.

I have a bunch of crypto on every kind of exchange but they won't let me kyc myself as I am a Canadian citizen. 

And tronscan shows up that I have a big amount, but my absence from stuff is causing all kinds of issues, like, with node and validation areas. I feel really bad I don't know yet how to fix this.  There is too much to get into right now in what I am finding issues in and details. I am looking for ethical technical assistance. Despite what I might look like, (Jk) I do have an IQ ranging from 125-140. :p Depends on  on the day I guess. :) So it's not because I can't get it learned, I just don't have the time to get enough expertise, in time. 



I am so grateful for this, regardless of the outcome, I feel like in my soul I regained a sense of amazement at this life and a sense of mystery and adventure has returned. I thought I lost any sparkle I had left so long ago. Tragedy, stress; no end in sight and now maybe I get a second chance at helping, in some small way, the worlds regular people save ourselves from tyranny and greed.



None of this, the amzing creation of the blockcgain and future unlimited potentials would have happened if it was not for people's relationships and shared ideals. We need to not forget that. That's is the only thing, I believe that can always trump the massive efforts of the greed machine. 



Please, any questions? I am only here to serve the causes of decentralized currency and the rights of an individual to pursue their own happiness's. This is where my heart is. 



I mean, some money would be great, but it's not the main point. I've learned how to survive with nothing and can comfortably live in that dynamic. Right now I am afraid that going forward,  I am too late to have anything I have to give make a difference. 





But maybe not, as I've come to see the truth is stranger than fiction, and Truth always comes out. Sometimes there is a happy ending. 



Yours,



Affectionately,





L. S. Nelkenbrecher



AKA Satoshi Nakamoto


I will fix the typos here when I get back to my laptop. This was done on a crap phone with a broken screen so I didn't bother to try spell check. I figure if it is decided I am telling the truth, there is going to be such intense scrutiny amd the last thing I need in this world is to be held up to some impossible level of perfection. I'm human, flawed like everyone, I have good days bad days and never drink my coffee with cream or sugar in it on weekdays, like my grandpa. 

I can't take much credit for this whole thing, as far as I see it every single person that has played a role by developing is Satoshi Nakamoto and most importantly the simple act of buying your daily living purchases with crypto if possible and adding options to buyers to pay this way of you have business's.. all the people of the world who have taken part are Satoshi Nakamoto.
This is the truth.
