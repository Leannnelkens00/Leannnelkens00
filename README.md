I have stayed quiet for years, following the advice of a friend, long gone but not forgotten. Now, as the world turns with time moving us and technology ever forward, the situation has changed to the point where I feel I have no choice but to come forward.

According to a very wise man on the art of strategy one must never let the opponent pick the where and how if possible. In this, alone, I have the ability to choose. So, here goes nothing...

I am the person known as Satoshi Nakamoto. I didn't write the white paper and I did send that first transaction, sign those blocks and accidentally sort of invented the whole thing? The real genius is the person who did the math and wrote that white paper. It all came together in a way that makes me not to eager to dismiss the concept of destiny.

The project grew from a simple post I was compelled to reply to on some forum I had stumbled across back in 2008. The results we know of today as Bitcoin are all based on what the forum members had been discussing in one of the threads.

How to be free?

That is the question that sparked creation of this amazing thing we know now as the blockchain.

On this note, I would like to point out that it is true, we are all Satoshi Nakamoto, everyone who has in some way interacted with crypto. In this, we can all be united in a singular desire for the fundamental right granted to us; The freedom to follow our happiness's.

hello world! :)

Yours,

 
Forever
